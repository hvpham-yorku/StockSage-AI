# Team Organization

Trello was our primary tool for sharing ideas and working on documents for submissions. Initially we split up into a front-end and back-end development pair vetting each other's work. We also shared code repositories and a data server to store and access project-related files. Our meetings were conducted through Discord, which provided an effective platform for voice discussions and screen sharing, enabling efficient communication.

# Decision-Making Process

Our decision-making process was structured around reviewing the requirements and rubrics as a group. During our meetings, we systematically went through each criterion to ensure that our decisions aligned with the given guidelines. This method helped us reach a consensus efficiently while ensuring that every member's input was considered in the evaluation process.

# Prioritization

Priority of user stories came from the basic idea of sprints leading to a minimum working product at the beginning and a working system at the end of each sprint. The highest priority user stories are the stories that describe the minimum requirements to use the product as described in the project objectives. This took us 3 rounds of voting with different ideas.

# Meeting Frequency

We met regularly, approximately three to four times a week. This frequent interaction enabled us to maintain momentum, address concerns promptly, and adapt to any necessary changes effectively.

Friday, Sunday, Monday, Wednesday at a specified time agreed upon depending on each person's schedule.

# Next Phase

- Use trello more often as using a single google doc is not the most efficient method of sharing ideas
- Be more focused on a common goal/structure as each person's battling ideas could get in the way of building each user story
